# West-Nile-Virus-Data-Science
This is a collection of software I wrote during the summer of 2023 to aid an Ph.D. student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in data analysis with the West Nile Virus.

# Web Scraping

The first project I made consisted on web scraping data off of an Illinois Governmental Database, and that code is located under the web scraping folder

# Welding

The second project I worked on had me taking data from a multitude of places the Ph.D. student had compiled them from, and weld that data was West Nile Virus cases to create a large spreadsheet for all of Illinois. The code for this project is under the file_welding folder.

# TIF Manipulation

The third project I worked on required me to handle .TIF files (image data), and turn them into usable climate data. The code for that is under the tif_manipulation folder

# Machine Learning

The fourth project I worked on was a foray into machine learning where I took the welded dataframe from the second project and ran many machine learning models on it. The code for those models is located in the machine_learning folder.

# Final US Combinations

The final project I worked on led me to create a master database with climate and West Nile Virus data from the entire United States in the past 20 years. The code for that work is located in the us_combinations folder.
